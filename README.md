- My current skills and knowledge on the radar
- We can only go by the expressions fixed by the tool, the following is my personal usage

  - Adopt: Currently using it frequently and familiar with it
  - Trial: Currently using or able to use
  - Assess: I haven't gotten around to using it yet, but I'm using it.
  - Hold: Items that used to be used but are used less frequently these days or are almost forgotten

- In other words, those in the center of the circle are used more frequently and those on the outside are used less frequently
